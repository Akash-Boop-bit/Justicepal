        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Justice K. Chandru, a former judge of the Madras High Court, is renowned
        for his integrity, progressive judgments, and commitment to social
        justice. His illustrious career as a lawyer and judge earned him a
        reputation as a fearless advocate for the marginalized and oppressed.
        His life and work have been an inspiration for many, including the
        creators of the acclaimed 2021 Tamil film Jai Bhim, which is based on
        one of his landmark cases.<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Early Life and Legal Career:<br></br>
        K. Chandru was born on May 9, 1951, in Mylapore, Chennai. He studied law
        at the Madras Law College and began his legal career as an advocate in
        1976. Chandru quickly gained a reputation for his dedication to justice
        and his unwavering support for human rights and civil liberties.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a lawyer, Chandru was involved in numerous cases defending the rights
        of laborers, Dalits, tribal communities, and other marginalized groups.

        her husband, who was wrongfully detained and went missing while in
        police custody.<br></br>

        The film captures Chandru's dedication to human rights and his
        relentless pursuit of justice for the oppressed. His involvement in the
        case, his determination to stand up against systemic injustice, and his
        unwavering support for the marginalized community make him a central
        figure in the film.<br></br>

        have left an indelible mark on the lives of many. His story, as
